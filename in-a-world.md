In a world of monsters, one man holds the key.

This man was a simple gardener, who found the key while plowing his fields.  

The key is blue and opens only one door in the castle. The castle belonged to the Locke family. It had many invisible doors that are only revealed through finding all the keys.

Now, he alone must journey to discover the secrets of the universe.  The first secret he must investigate is why he's been so gassy lately.  And unfortunately, that man must travel through a vortex.

While he traveled through the vortex, he encountered the giant penguin who wields daggers.

He lands in the world without tacos. Devastated he traveled far and wide for the best ingredients to create the ultimate taco.

He falls terribly ill from eating mushrooms.
