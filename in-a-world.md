In a world of monsters, one man holds the key. 

This man was a simple gardener, who found the key while plowing his fields.  The key is blue and opens all the doors in the castle. 

Now, he alone must journey to discover the secrets of the universe.  And unfortunately, that man must travel through a vortex.
He lands in the world without tacos. He falls terribly ill from eating mushrooms.
