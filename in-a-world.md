In a world of monsters, one man holds the key.

This man was a simple gardener, who found the key while plowing his fields.  The key is blue and opens all the doors in the castle. 

Now, he alone must journey to discover the secrets of the universe.  The first secret he must investigate is why he's been so gassy lately.  And unfortunately, that man must travel through a vortex.

While he traveled through the vortex, he encountered the giant penguin who wields daggers.

He lands in the world without tacos.
