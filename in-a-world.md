In a world of monsters, one man holds the key. But the door is not locked!

This man was a simple gardener, who found the key while plowing his fields.  

The key is blue and opens only one door in the castle. The castle belonged to the Locke family. It had many invisible doors that are only revealed through finding all the keys.

Now, he alone must journey to discover the secrets of the universe.  The first secret he must investigate is why he's been so gassy lately. And unfortunately, that man must travel through a vortex.

While he traveled through the vortex, he encountered the giant penguin who wields daggers. The penguin hugs and gives him a rusty dagger and says, "Only with my dagger and your key, will you become a legend that everyone will be taco-ing about for years to come."

He lands in the world without tacos. Devastated he traveled far and wide for the best ingredients to create the ultimate taco.

He falls terribly ill from eating mushrooms. 

Despite his illness, he was determined to uncover the truth behind the Locke family's secret, pushing himself to unravel the mystery even in the throes of his sickness.

After 10 years into his illness, he finally decided to go on a journey to find the best doctor and wizard in the world. That wizard's name was Hermione Granger. When he found Hermione Granger, they went on a journey together to gather the things needed to make the antidote for his illness.

He propelled himself weakly back towards the vortex, clutching his stomach as it revolted violently against the mushrooms.
He thinked he'd breathed his last, he feared.
And that's when the mushroom people attacked!

He nearly got squished to death by the mushroom people until Hermione suddenly showed up and blasted them all with her spell and turned them into harmless little roasted mushrooms.

And they lived happily ever after.

Until Taco Bell raised the price of the Cravings Box...
