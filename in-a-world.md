The key is blue and opens all the doors in the castle.


In a world of monsters, one man holds the key. This man was a simple gardener, who found the key while plowing his fields.  Now, he alone must journey to discover the secrets of the universe.
The key is blue and opens all the doors in the castle. But the door is not locked!  Place holder text. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex. Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf. Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex!
