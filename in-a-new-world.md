This is the new world

In a new world, something else was happening totally unrelated to the last one.

Toad walked down the wrong pipe in the mushroom kingdom and crawled out of the dirty sewers of NYC.

Toad sees Bowser approaching and proceeds to open his domain.

Bowser with an intense stare angrily says: "where is Mario!?"

Toad, covered in city grime but surprisingly upbeat, quips, "He's not here, but he left you a shaved ice!"

Bowser proceeded to eat the shaved ice while mumbling something about Princess Peach having Bowser Jr. for the weekend.

As Bowser savored the shaved ice, a distant roar echoed through the alleys, signaling the unexpected arrival of an old rival.

Mario had eaten his own mutant shaved ice, giving him the ability to transform into a twenty foot tall shaved ice cone.
