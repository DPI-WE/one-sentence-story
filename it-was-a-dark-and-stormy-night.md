It was a dark and stormy night. 

A dragon with her 3 new born children arrived at the mountain near the king's kingdom near Chicago. And then all of a sudden it started raining tacos out of nowhere so everyone decided to take a second to eat. 

After their bellies were filled they felt like it was high time for a rampage. 
When they were about to start the rampage a sudden portal appeared in the air. 
Her dragon husband stepped through and bellowed his dragon mistress is 36 months pregnant. Her dragon brother disapproved of this coupling. 

Her dragon brother was the king of the dragons. 

Suddenly, a new portal appears and out comes the dragon king's own mistress and 20 step-dragons. 

Freyja bolted out with the litter of half-human, half-dragon babies in tow, and with her hand on her hip, she urgently requested that they resolve their issues in therapy. 

All 20 of the babies suddenly learned how to use their dragon wings and started to fly away. 

The 20 baby dragons realized they wanted to be human, so they flew to a witch to get advice. 

One of the dragons sneezed as the witch was giving them human lives, and killed the witch with fire. 

After the witch was killed the dragons would continue on their journey to become human. 

They then went searching for a wizard. 

Little did they know, though, that the witch's sister wanted revenge. 

Now, they are a bit afraid of being killed by the witch's sister and plan to do something to save themselves. 

They found a mysterious potion hidden in a forest and decided to drink it and they started to feel sleepy. 

When they woke up they discovered they were tiny and eight-legged and hungry for flies - they had turned into spiders!

After 24 hours the potion wore off and they returned back to normal but the witch was still in hot pursuit so they decided to split up.
