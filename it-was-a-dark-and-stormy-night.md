It was a dark and stormy night. A dragon with her 3 new born children arrived at the mountain near the king's kingdom near Chicago. And then all of a sudden it started raining tacos out of nowhere so everyone decided to take a second to eat. After their bellies were filled they felt like it was high time for a rampage. When they were about to start the rampage a sudden portal appeared in the air. Her dragon husband stepped through and bellowed his dragon mistress is 36 months pregnant. Her dragon brother disapproved of this coupling. Her dragon brother was the king of the dragons. Suddenly, a new portal appears and out comes the dragon king's own mistress and 20 step-dragons. Freyja bolted out with the litter of half-human, half-dragon babies, and with her hand on her hip, she urgently requested that they resolve their issues on Maury.
